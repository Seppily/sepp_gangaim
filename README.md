Hey guys!

upload://lHC6QXZ3HBJo0OWeMOEAtWuVQ2p.png  I saw a lot of request to make this script compatible with FiveM -> https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/gangster-aim 
So I've created a Script for that.

**What exactly is Gangster Aim?**
This script allows you to give different jobs a chance to aim like a gangster.


You can configurate jobs in the client.lua, which should aim like a boss.
